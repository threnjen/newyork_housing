    "> This is an in-depth notebook which explores the Austin Housing Dataset through several different models. The notebook includes a thorough EDA and cleaning section, natural language processing on text descriptions, exploration of different models using different categorical methods (one-hot encoding vs target encoding) with extensive parameter tuning, an evaluation of the final model, and visualizations.\n",

    "Gradient Boosting performs best with optimal parameter tuning. We're going to use sklearn's GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters to use with our gradient booster! Here are the parameters we are trying out:\n",
    "\n",
    "* n_estimators: Number of boosts to perform. Gradient boosting is pretty robust to over-fitting so more is usually better\n",
    "* max_depth: This determines how many tree nodes the estimator looks at before making a prediction. We don't know what is best here, so we are trying things from 2-4 to see what works the best\n",
    "* min_child_weight: Min sum of instance weight needed in a child\n",
    "* gamma: Minimum loss reduction to make another partition on a leaf node. Higher results in more conservative algorithm.\n",
    "* subsample: Ratio of training sets. .5 means that it will sample half the training data before making trees. Occurs with each boosting iteration.\n",
    "* colsample_by_tree: ratio of columns when making a tree\n",
    "* alpha: L1 regularization. Higher will make model more conservative.\n",
    "* learning_rate: Tuning this setting alters how much the model corrects after it runs a boost. .1 is a common rate and we will test a lower and higher rate as well."

I tried several different transformations including polynomial features, mean target encoding, lower-granularity binning, and median rank as a continuous, and ALL of these efforts resulted in a lower R^2 and higher mean absolute error, leading to a final decision to one-hot encode all 70 zip codes individually. Similar efforts on other categoricals such as age and month sold also did not improve the model over one-hot encoding.

    "# Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the primary factors influencing housing prices in the King County metro area?\n",
    "> As square footage increases so does quality of materials. Most importantly you can see the upward price trend with both increased square footage and materials grade. I was intrigued that our lower bound of data points is very linear, but as our square footage increases, the upper bound gradually breaks away with higher variance. \n",
    "\n",
    ">I ranked the 70 zip codes in King County by median home value, and used those ranks to color our data points.  Our low median zip codes have a low price per square footage, and price per square foot increases with zip code median, which makes sense, but also shows the importance of zip code to pricing. I found it interesting that while most zip codes exhibit a clear trend of price per square foot decreasing with increased total square footage, which is entirely normal, certain very high value zip codes seem to retain their high price per square foot regardless of total square footage. Certain zip codes seem immune to the usual price per square foot decay. \n",
    "\n",
    "> As they say, location is everything, and it is the primary influencing factor for a home price in the King County metro area. Our darkest areas, and therefore highest value sales, are clustered in and around Seattle to the west of Lake Washington and into the eastern lake cities of Bellevue and Redmond which are the technical employer hubs of the region. As we move away from Seattle and the tech hubs into the suburbs, our prices clearly go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These three features alone explain 85% of the price variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can we effectively use a regression model based system for realtors to determine a proper list price?\n",
    "> Our regression model, while explaining over 88% of the price variance with our features, was nonetheless far from accurate in absolute terms. A mean average error of 55k in either direction is a huge variance to a home price - one that is so large that it renders the prediction much less meaningful and useful. Other models need to be explored, better data needs to be sourced, or easy-to-use features that an average realtor is capable of evaluating/acquiring should be added to the model to improve its predictive quality. The model is providing at best a baseline starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is a model-based system more accurate for determining list price than the traditional comps-based system?\n",
    ">At present, the regression model is only slightly more accurate than the comps-based system on our test data - and this is even with our comps-based simulator lacking a feature set as robust as our model. In fact our realtor simulator performed better on new data than our model. The model is lacking something - quality start data, predictive features, proper feature engineering, or something else - and we should identify and include them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> With our model one major pro is it is a mathematical model and we can use it without housing data on hand. It would be benefited by up to date data, but it doesn't require it to function. This certainly results in less labor overhead as it only needs occasional updating. However the wide error range gives only a starting point, and it ultimately requires human intervention to determine final price, which is likely a comps-based manual pass anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The comps based system, on the other hand, is a familiar method for realtors. It somehow more accurately captures the location granularity that the model misses. And most importantly, it can still be accomplished programmatically, as I've demonstrated, which can provide a quicker starting point for a realtor instead of them identifying the comps manually. The downside here is cost of maintenance - the comps finder requires the entire data set to be present to function, and it must be updated frequently, preferably daily, for most accurate results. With that in mind the realtor simulator requires a lot more overhead to remain usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What easy-to-use features can we add to our model to increase its accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    ">I would consider two different models that separate urban and suburban areas, to better capture the non-decaying price per square foot in our high value zip codes that we saw back on our square footage visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I'd source better data for this project. Data that includes the type of sale would be incredibly important to weed out non-market sales which may be hurting our model.  When I searched out new data on which to test our completed model I saw a large proportion of non-standard sales on record, and this adds noise to our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I want to use latitude and longitude as a more granular location identifier in place of zip code\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we add features to the model, they need to be ones that an average realtor is capable of finding and utilizing with average Google skills. We could add frontend GUI features and backend web scraping that allows some of these things to be run by the model software. For example, using latititude and longitude, GreatSchools.org can tell a property's exact school assignments and ratings. A realtor doesn't know lat and long, but we can use under the hood web scraping that takes the address and uses a reverse address finder such as at https://www.latlong.net/Show-Latitude-Longitude.html to determine lat/long, then takes that result to GreatSchools.org to scrape for school information. Lat/long can also be utilized within the model in combination with the many GIS map tools available from King County about public services, parks, school districts, area income and more to obtain and enter data without the realtor needing to do any more than enter an address.\n"
